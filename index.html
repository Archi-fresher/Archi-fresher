            <p class="para"> Web development is the work involved in developing a website for the Internet (World Wide Web) or an intranet (a private network). 
                 Web development can range from developing a simple single static page of plain text to complex web applications, electronic businesses, and social network services.
                 A more comprehensive list of tasks to which Web development commonly refers, may include Web engineering, Web design, Web content development, client liaison, client-side/server-side scripting, Web server and network security configuration, and e-commerce development.

    <div class="h" id="html"><!--HTML--> 

        <h3 class="title">HTML</h3>
        <p class="para">The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. 
            It is often assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.
             Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages.
              HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for its appearance.

    <div class="c" id="css"><!--css--> 
    <h3 class="title"> CSS</h3>
    <p class="para">Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML).[1] CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.[2]

        CSS is designed to enable the separation of content and presentation, including layout, colors, and fonts.
        This separation can improve content accessibility; provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics;
         enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content; and enable the.
        css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.

    <div class="b" id="boot"><!--bootstrap-->
        <h3 class="title"> BOOTSTRAP</h3>
        <p class="para">Bootstrap is a free and open-source CSS framework directed at responsive, mobile-first front-end web development. 
            It contains HTML, CSS and (optionally) JavaScript-based design templates for typography, forms, buttons, navigation, and other interface components.Bootstrap is an HTML, CSS and JS library that focuses on simplifying the development of informative web pages (as opposed to web applications). The primary purpose of adding it to a web project is to apply Bootstrap's choices of color, size, font and layout to that project.
             As such, the primary factor is whether the developers in charge find those choices to their liking. Once added to a project, 
             Bootstrap provides basic style definitions for all HTML elements.

    <div class="j" id="java"> <!--javascript-->
        <h3 class="title">JAVASCRIPT</h3>
        <p class="para">JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. 
            As of 2022, 98% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for webpage behavior, often incorporating third-party libraries.
             All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on users' devices.
               JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript standard.
             It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. 
             It is multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles.
              It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).
